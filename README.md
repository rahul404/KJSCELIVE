<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The KJSCE Live app was conceptualized keeping in mind the need to have a centralized information source as well as a noticeboard for all things related to the college. Information about all college student bodies and activities is made available on the platform, as well as news relevant to students.
This application is developed and maintained by KJSCE Students’ Council. The Students’ Council is the primary student body of the college that works towards the major events in the academic year, including Abhiyantriki, Skream, and Symphony, and everything in between.
